# jessa-reset.css

I'm making my own CSS reset based on Eric Meyer's (http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/). From there I will make it my own. I'll add in bits that I find myself adding in all my projects. I will also probably add in things based on research; maybe some base typography standards, stuff like that. Maybe I will maintain both a commented and an uncommented version to remind myself why I chose things. Maybe I will add commented reminders for things I might forget (like adding a note to add :focus styles if I remove the :focus outline).
