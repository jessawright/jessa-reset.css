# jessa-reset.css

I'm making my own CSS reset based on others I have seen, combining what I like, taking out what I don't, and adding in the things I regularly end up changing.

+ Started with Eric Meyer's reset (http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/).  
+ Removed deprecated HTML elements.
+ Add selections from Normalize.css (http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).
+ Add selections from undohtml.css (http://tantek.com/log/2004/undohtml.css).
+ Add some typographic scaling (adapted from http://typecast.com/blog/a-more-modern-scale-for-web-typography).
